                                                            Summary
In the era of big data and reliable algorithms, data classification is instrumental in the field of astronomical research. In this project, 
we explore supervised classification methods such as Random Forest, Decision Tree and Random Forest. We applied these methods to classify 
the dataset as Star, Galaxy or Quasar along with comparing different classification models to find the superior one.

                                                            Background
In the branches of astronomy, the classification of celestial objects is essential. The ability to collect data samples of stars, galaxies, 
and quasars is its main advantage. Even though quasars are crucial to a variety of astronomical studies and research, their sample sizes are 
still in the relative minority group. Significant increases in the sample sizes of quasars and other astronomical objects can only be produced 
through improved data classification methods, which will then make it possible to advance study. The use of machine learning models in the task 
of classification has grown more significant and common as contemporary telescopes capture a growing amount of astronomical data due to their precision and speed.
The classification models of random forest and support vector model (SVM), along with decision tree and Boosting Trees, were used with supervised
machine learning models to either exclusively identify and distinguish quasars from other objects or to classify all three of the objects: stars, 
galaxies, and quasars. Additionally, the fact that numerous supervised classification models were trained using data from kaggle.com shows that 
the information and variables the dataset supplies are comprehensive, trustworthy, and closely related to the objective of identifying celestial objects.
